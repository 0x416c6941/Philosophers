# Philosophers
**Philosophers** is a project to solve the *Dining Philosopher problem*.
<br>
It's used as an introduction to concurrent programming in a *42 School*.

## Building and usage
To build the project, simply type:
```
make
```
To run, use:
```
./philo numbers_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

## Limitations
Please note that this program may not work as expected on **slower hardware**.
<br>
It's generally not recommended to run it with more than *200 philosophers*.

## Special thanks
